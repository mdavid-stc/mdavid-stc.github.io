## Measuring the Speed of Light
The data is from a series of 5 experiments (20 runs each) carried out in 1879 attempting to measure the speed of light.
```{r fig.align="center", warn=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
set.seed(654654)

michelson <- transform(morley, Expt = factor(Expt), Run = factor(Run))
correct <- 299792 - 299000  # The correct speed of light in km/sec

xax <- list(
  title = "Experiment No."
)
yax <- list(
  title = "Speed Estimate"
)

plot_ly(michelson, x = ~Expt, y = ~Speed, type = "box", color = ~Expt) %>%
    add_trace(y = correct, color = "Actual") %>%
    layout(title = "19th century Attempts to Measure Lightspeed", xaxis = xax, yaxis = yax)
```
Most estimates overshot the true value of [299]792 km/sec.
